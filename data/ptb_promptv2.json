While the forecast is slightly higher than this historical average, it remains consistent with the overall trend of minimal conflict.

While the forecast is slightly higher than the historical average, it remains in line with the country's stable and peaceful record. Botswana’s risk factors, including higher-than-average infant mortality and lower-than-average military executive power, play a marginal role in the forecast, with the latter contributing to the low risk of conflict.

      "output": "In March 2026, Zimbabwe has a 0.0% probability of experiencing at least 25 battle deaths, with a forecast of 0.0 battle deaths on average. This places Zimbabwe in the category of Near-certain no conflict, consistent with its historical trend of zero fatalities. Comparable countries for this month include Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The primary reason for this forecast is Zimbabwe's long-standing absence of violence, with no recorded fatalities due to state-based armed conflict in recent years. While the forecast is slightly higher than the historical average, it remains in line with the overall stable trend. Zimbabwe does have risk factors that are higher than average, particularly in infant mortality and military executive power, which could marginally elevate the risk of conflict. However, these factors are not sufficient to significantly alter the forecast, given the strong historical trend of no violence.",
